//TODO
// Java Abstract Class
// Create another class, MyBook, that extends the abstract class Book within the exercise
//
// class MyBook extends Book {
//    @Override
//    void setTitle(String s){
//        this.title = s;
//    }
//}


//TODO
// Java Interface
// You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature int divisor_sum(int n). You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the interface.
//Read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. You just need to write the MyCalculator class only. Your class shouldn't be public.
//class MyCalculator implements AdvancedArithmetic {
//    public int divisor_sum(int n) {
//        if (n <= 1) { return n; }
//
//        int res = n + 1;
//        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
//            if(n % i == 0) {
//                res += i;
//            }
//        }
//        return res;
//    }
//}
//


// TODO Java Method Overriding
//     Complete the code in your editor by writing an overridden getNumberOfTeamMembers method that prints the same statement as the superclass' getNumberOfTeamMembers method, except that it replaces n with 11 (the number of players on a Soccer team).
//
//void getNumberOfTeamMembers(){
//        System.out.println("Each team has 11 players in Soccer Class");
//    };
//


// TODO Java Method Overriding 2 (Super Keyword)
//     When a method in a subclass overrides a method in superclass, it is still possible to call the overridden method using super keyword. If you write super.func() to call the function func(), it will call the method that was defined in the superclass.
//
//You are given a partially completed code in the editor. Modify the code so that the code prints the following text:
//Hello I am a motorcycle, I am a cycle with an engine.
//My ancestor is a cycle who is a vehicle with pedals.
//
//
//String temp=super.define_me();
//
